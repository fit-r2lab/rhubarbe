# images

* improvement: image names cannot be cut'n paste in a terminal because of required backslashes
* improvement: before saving an image, store some stamp in `/rimage.id`
* improvement: an option to display `saving` images or not, in which case some parsing could be welcome
* bugfix: in some case during the save (with .partial), I have seen weird output with `{:03f}` or similar
